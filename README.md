# Quantum Resonance VR

Welcome to Quantum Resonance VR! Join with a couple of friends in leveraging the power of string theory to become creators of the cosmos in this web-based VR application, built using open-source software such as A-Frame, WebGL, Three.js, and Node.js. Work together to vibrate strings to instantiate the world around you in an otherwise uncertain, undefined, randomly changing universe. Race against time before the Plank Epoch ends to create unique environments, competing against other players to create the most unique environment. At the end of Planck Epoch, players will vote for the player who created the most unique environment.

### Collaborate to Build the Universe

---

Players will enter an empty universe where objects randomly phase between different states and characteristics, representing the undefined and unrealized potential state of the universe before particle strings vibrate, according to String Theory. Using the floating particle strings around the player, they can vibrate the various strings in order to instantiate and define the objects around them. As a team, multiple players work together to build the universe around them, racing against time before the Plank Epoch ends (referring to the events occuring 0 t 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang where all of the fundamental forces and matter in the universe were in one giant melting pot). Players must instantiate 100% of the objects in the universe in order to win the game.

### Compete to Create Unique Environments

---

Whilst instantiating the universe together, players can compete to create the most unique environments through vibrating the various strings with different frequencies. Different vibrations and strings affect certain attributes in the floating object, such as its color, size, geometry, rotation, and position. At the end of the Planck Epoch, players can vote for the player who created the most interesting environments.

# Quantum Resonance VR

Welcome to Quantum Resonance VR! Invite friends in leveraging the power of string theory to become creators of the cosmos in this web-based VR application, built using open-source software such as A-Frame, WebGL, Three.js, and Node.js. Work together to vibrate strings to instantiate the world around you in an otherwise empty and undefined changing universe. Race against time before the Plank Epoch ends to create the cosmos by working together as a team. But be wary, at the end of the game players will have a chance to vote on the player who created the most unique and interesting environment. Will you help your teammates to create the universe before the time runs out? Or will you spend your time focusing on creating your own masterpiece?

## Objective

### Collaborate to Build the Universe

---

As a player, you will enter an empty universe, representing the undefined and unrealized potential state of the universe before particle strings vibrate, according to String Theory. Using the floating particle strings in front of you, you can vibrate the strings in different configurations to instantiate and define the objects in front of you. Switch between different strings to affect different properties with the objects. As a team, you must work together to build the universe around you, ensuring the universe is 100% complete before the Plank Epoch ends. Do you and your friends have what it takes to create the universe in time?

### Compete to Create Unique Environments

---

Whilst instantiating the universe together, you must also compete to create the most unique environments, using various string configurations and object placement to do so. Different vibrations and strings affect certain attributes in the floating object, such as its color, size, geometry, rotation, and position. At the end of the Planck Epoch, all of the players can vote for the player who created the most interesting environments. Do you have the power within you to be the master creator of the universe?

### Instructions to Play

---

This project is currently not deployed to a server or url, therefore in order to play you must run and serve the application locally. In order to do this, please complete the following steps to run locally:

**Please note that this game is currently only available on desktop. There may be updates in the future to make it compatible with more platforms (such as VR and mobile)**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory in the terminal
3. Type the following commands (make sure you have Node Package Manager installed):
   - `npm install express --save`
   - `npm install aframe-physics-system --save`
4. Follow the steps to install ngrok => [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)
5. Type `ngrok http 8080` in your terminal
   5.1. This will produce a url. Share that url with your friends and paste the url in your preferred browser
   <br>
   <br>

#### Controls

<br>
Once you've followed the steps above, press the "Play Experience" button to start playing the game. Please be aware that as soon as one player presses the "Player Experience" button, the countdown timer will begin.

Use the WASD keys to move around the environment. Left click and drag to change your looking direction.

Modify the floating strings by right clicking and dragging on the string. You'll notice the string start to bend and twist. Once you release the right mouse button, the changes in the string will affect the corresponding properties in the objects floating in front of you. Use 'q' and 'e' to switch between different strings, which affect different properties of the objects. Once finished, press the space bar to instantiate your objects in the desired location. You may then continue this same process to create more objects.

Whilst playing, press the 'i' key to view the controls.
